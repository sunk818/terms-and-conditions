Description of PiggyBox
PiggyBox is a hardware device that allows you to install a software component that occasionally uses your IP address to download web pages from well known Internet sites, in consideration of payments made to you. This is done in a way that does not interrupt your use of the Internet. The webpages are then sent to Bright Data’s customers, who use them to improve their databases, offer better products, services and pricing. PiggyBox includes hardware (boxed PCB board containing Software) and relevant accessories such as cables (Flash memory card, LAN cable, charger etc). 

Payment. BrightData will pay you on a monthly basis via your chosen payment method. All payments are in US Dollars. You are responsible for any taxes if applicable. In order to be eligible for payment, the PiggyBox must be linked to a PiggyBox account and remain connected to the Internet 24/7 without interruption. If BrightData detects that the PiggyBox is not online for extended periods of time during a calendar month, it reserves the right to pay a reduced rate (or even not pay at all).

You are solely responsible for the PiggyBox operational costs (electricity and Internet connection).
