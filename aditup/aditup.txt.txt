End User License Agreement for Ad It Up

 

Last Updated: Nov 29, 2021

Play2Pay Inc. (the “Company”, “us”, or “we”) provides a mobile application for the delivery of targeted and preferred advertisement content to users that allows such users to earn reward points for certain actions by each user and further enables users to redeem reward points for discounts on your communications services provider(s) (“Service Provider”)’s bills or for gift cards or other items (collectively, the “Play2Pay Program”).  As a user (“you” or “your”) of the Play2Pay mobile application (the “App”), this Play2Pay Program Terms of Service and End User License Agreement (this “Agreement”), as such Agreement may be amended by us from time to time in our sole discretion, governs your use of the App. As used in this Agreement, references to “Services” include the services we provide to you under this Agreement.  As used in this Agreement, references to our “Affiliates” include our owners, licensees, assigns, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, officers, directors, suppliers, partners, sponsors, and advertisers, and includes (without limitation) all parties involved in creating, producing, and/or delivering the Service and/or contents available through the App under the terms of this Agreement.

BEFORE DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACCESSING OR USING THE APP, PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN PLAY2PAY AND YOU. BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACCESSING OR USING THE APP, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, YOU SHOULD UNINSTALL THE APP IMMEDIATELY. YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE APP OR THE PLAY2PAY PROGRAM IS TO CEASE USING THE APP AND CEASE PARTICIPATING IN THE PLAY2PAY PROGRAM. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS DISCLAIMERS AND OTHER PROVISIONS THAT LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU.

THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT GOVERNS ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US, WHICH (A) ELIMINATES YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY; AND (B) SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING PREVENTING YOU FROM BRINGING, JOINING OR PARTICIPATING IN CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDINGS.

You agree that we may provide notices, disclosures and amendments, modifications and updates to this Agreement by electronic means, including by changing the Agreement within the App or by posting amendments, modifications or updates on Play2Pay’s website at www.play2pay.com, or other URL designated by US from time to time. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to periodically review this Agreement. Your continued use of the App or participation in the Play2Pay Program after such amendment, modification or update will constitute acknowledgement and acceptance of the modified terms and conditions of this Agreement.

10)        Arbitration, Governing Law and Attorney Fees.

a)        Arbitration and Governing Law. Both parties expressly agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a “Claim”) shall be settled by binding arbitration in Broward County, Florida, in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Florida, excluding its conflict of laws provisions, and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Further, it is mutually agreed that judgment upon any award rendered by a single arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Company agree not to challenge any award given by the appointed Arbitrator, and to waive any claims or defenses that were not raised during Arbitration.
If either party elects to resolve a Claim by arbitration, that Claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis. There shall be no right or authority for any Claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other users of the App or Services or other persons similarly situated. The arbitrator’s authority to resolve Claims is limited to Claims between you and us alone, and the arbitrator’s authority to make awards is limited to you and us alone. Furthermore, Claims brought by you against us or by us against you may not be joined or consolidated in arbitration with Claims brought by or against someone other than you, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by all parties.  This section of this Arbitration Provision is the “Class Action Waiver.”

b)        Attorney Fees. The party that is deemed to have prevailed in Arbitration shall be entitled to collect from the other party the reasonable attorney fees and other legal costs and expenses that prevailing party shall incur in litigation and in enforcing its legal rights.
11)        Miscellaneous.

a)        No Resale Right. You agree not to sell, resell, reproduce, duplicate, distribute, copy or use for any commercial purposes any portion of this App, or use of or access to the Service provided pursuant to this Agreement, and subject to express rights and obligations granted to you herein.
b)        Successors and Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns, beneficiaries, or designees. You acknowledge and agree that the Company may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to another company, and that, upon such transfer and your acceptance of this Agreement, the transferee of the Company’s rights and obligations under this Agreement shall have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary.
c)        Force Majeure. In addition to any excuse provided by applicable law, the Company shall be excused from liability for non-delivery or delay in delivery of products or Service under this Agreement arising from any event beyond our reasonable control, whether or not foreseeable by either party, including but not limited to: labor disturbance, strike, war, terrorism, fire, accident, act of God, adverse weather, inability to secure transportation, governmental act or regulation, court or governmental order, electronic malfunction, Internet delivery failure and other causes or events beyond the reasonable control of the Company, whether or not similar to those which are enumerated above.
d)        Validity. If any part or provision in this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining parts shall remain in full force and effect.
e)        No Waiver. The waiver by either party of any default or breach of this Agreement, or failure to enforce any particular provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of the party’s rights to enforce the same provision or term of this Agreement at another time, nor shall it constitute a waiver of any other provision or term of this Agreement or a waiver of the subsequent default or breach.
f)        Entire Agreement. The terms and conditions contained in this Agreement constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings of the parties with respect thereto. This Agreement may NOT be altered, supplemented, or amended by the use of any other document(s).
