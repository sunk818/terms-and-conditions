We may also block delivery of a communication (like email, file sharing or instant message) to or from the Services in an effort to enforce these Terms or we may remove or refuse to publish Your Content for any reason. When investigating alleged violations of these Terms, Microsoft reserves the right to review Your Content in order to resolve the issue. However, we cannot monitor the entire Services and make no attempt to do so.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">c. <strong>Application to Xbox Services.</strong> Click <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/legal/community-standards">here</a> (https://www.xbox.com/en-US/legal/community-standards) for more information about how this Code of Conduct applies to all Xbox Services, including Xbox Game Pass, Games for Windows Live and Xbox Game Studios games, applications, services and content provided by Microsoft.

This means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738" target="_blank">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738</a> or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you.  Please see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account.  You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you.  If we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership.  Based on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content.  If you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website: <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656" target="_blank">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656</a>.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">iii.
                        <strong>Kids and Accounts.</strong> By creating a Microsoft account or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and represent that you have either reached the age of “majority” where you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf.  If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help.  If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and are responsible for all use of the Microsoft account or Services, including purchases, whether the minor’s account is now open or created later.</li><li>iv.
                        <strong>Closing Your Account.</strong><ul><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">1. You can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account at any time and for any reason.  To close your Microsoft account, please visit <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618278" target="_blank">https://account.live.com/closeaccount.aspx</a>. When you ask us to close your Microsoft account, you can choose to put it  in a suspended state for either 30 or 60 days just in case you change your mind.  After that 30- or 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed. Logging back in during the suspension period will reactivate your Microsoft account.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">2. If your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen. First, your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately. Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). You should have a regular backup plan as Microsoft won’t be able to retrieve Your Content or Data once your account is closed. Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">b.
                <strong>Work or School Accounts.</strong> You can sign into certain Microsoft services with a work or school email address. If you do, you agree that the owner of the domain associated with your email address may be notified of the existence of your Microsoft account and its associated subscriptions, control and administer your account, and access and process your Data, including the contents of your communications and files, and that Microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or Data is compromised. You further agree that your use of the Microsoft services may be subject to the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organization and these Terms may not apply.  If you already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access Services covered under these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services.
            </li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">c.
                <strong>Additional Equipment/Data Plans.</strong> To use many of the Services, you’ll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan. You might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone. You are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans, and equipment. Those fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the Services and we will not reimburse you for such fees. Check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you.
            </li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">d.
                <strong>Service Notifications.</strong> When there’s something we need to tell you about a Service you use, we’ll send you Service notifications.  If you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email or via SMS (text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and verifying your purchases. We may also send you Service notifications by other means (for example by in-product messages). <strong>Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS.</strong></li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">e.
                <strong>Support.</strong> Customer support for some Services is available at
                <a href="https://support.microsoft.com" target="_blank">https://support.microsoft.com</a>. Certain Services may offer separate or additional customer support, subject to the terms available at
                <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/support-service-agreement" target="_blank">www.microsoft.com/support-service-agreement</a>, unless otherwise specified. Support may not be available for preview or beta versions of features or Services.
             </li><li>f.
                <strong>Ending your Services.</strong> If your Services are canceled (whether by you or us), first your right to access the Services stops immediately and your license to the software related to the Services ends.  Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Service or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you).  As a result you may no longer be able to access any of the Services (or Your Content that you’ve stored on those Services). You should have a regular backup plan. Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired. If you have canceled your Microsoft account and have no other account able to access the Services your Services may be canceled immediately.

                <strong>Charges.</strong> If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge. 
                The price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. 
                The price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. 
                Taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered. We may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, 
                full payment from you. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content. 
                Connecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">b.
                <strong>Your Billing Account.</strong> To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time
                you sign up for that Service. You can access and change your billing information and payment method on the 
                <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281" target="_blank">Microsoft account management website</a> (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing 
                into your account portal at <a href="https://skype.com/go/myaccount" target="_blank">https://skype.com/go/myaccount</a>. Additionally, you agree to permit Microsoft
                to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable
                payment network. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, 
                so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions.  Changes made to your
                billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes
                to your billing account.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">c.
                <strong>Billing.</strong> By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment
                method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorize Microsoft to charge
                you for the Services or available content using your payment method; and (iii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for any
                paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. We may bill you (a) in
                advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services.
                Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount
                to be charged for recurring subscription Services. We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing
                periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">d.
                <strong>Recurring Payments.</strong> When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft. You must cancel your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services.  We will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services. By authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, <strong>"Electronic Payments"</strong>). Subscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period. If any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any such payment as an Electronic Payment.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">e.
                <strong>Online Statement and Errors.</strong> Microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the
                <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282" target="_blank">Microsoft account management website</a> (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282), where you can view and print your statement. For Skype, you can access your online statement by signing into your
                account at <a href="https://www.skype.com" target="_blank">www.skype.com</a> (https://www.skype.com). This is the only billing statement that we provide. If we make an error on your bill, you must
                tell us within 90 days after the error first appears on your bill. We will then promptly investigate the charge. If you do
                not tell us within that time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't
                be required to correct the error or provide a refund. If Microsoft has identified a billing error, we will correct that error
                within 90 days.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">f.
                <strong>Refund Policy.</strong> Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.
                If you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will
                be given for any charges more than 90 days old. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.
                If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund
                policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply. For more refund information, please visit our 
                <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283" target="_blank">help topic</a> (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283).</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">g.
                <strong>Canceling the Services.</strong> You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause. Cancelling paid Services stops future charges to continue the Service. To cancel a Service and request a refund, if you are entitled to one, visit the Microsoft account management website. You can request a refund from Skype using the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286" target="_blank">Cancellation and Refund form</a> (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286). You should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation; (ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges; (iii) you may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account for the Services before the date of cancellation; and (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services. We will process your Data as described above in section 4. If you cancel, your access to the Services ends at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you canceled. If you initiate a chargeback or reversal with your bank for your payment of Services, we will deem you to have canceled as of the date that the original payment was made, and you authorize us to immediately cancel your service and/or revoke any content that was provided to you in exchange for such payment.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">h.
                <strong>Trial-Period Offers.</strong> If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial Service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the trial period.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">i.
                <strong>Promotional Offers.</strong> From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will
                not charge you for the Services. Microsoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) if Microsoft determines 
                (in its reasonable discretion) that you are breaching the terms and conditions of the offer.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">j.
                <strong>Price Changes.</strong> We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will
                notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change. If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and
                stop using the Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer,
                that price will remain in force for the fixed term.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">k.
                <strong>Payments to You.</strong> If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information
                we need to get that payment to you. You are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment
                to you. You must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment. If you receive a payment in
                error, we may reverse or require return of the payment. You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this. We may 
                reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">l.
                <strong>Gift Cards.</strong> Redemption and use of gift cards (other than Skype gift cards) are governed by the
                <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions" target="_blank">Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions</a> (https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions). Information on Skype gift cards is available on
                <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383" target="_blank">Skype’s Help page</a> (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383).</li><li>m.
            	<strong>Bank Account Payment Method.</strong> You may register an eligible bank account with your Microsoft account to use it as a payment method. 
           		Eligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g., a United States-based 
            	financial institution that supports automated clearing house ("<strong>ACH</strong>") entries, a European financial institution that supports Single Euro Payments Area 
            	("<strong>SEPA</strong>") or "iDEAL" in the Netherlands).  Terms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account 
            	(e.g., the “mandate” in the case of SEPA) also apply. You represent and warrant that your registered bank account is held in your name 
            	or you are authorized to register and use this bank account as a payment method.  By registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, 
            	you authorize Microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or subscription charge 
            	(in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct errors, 
            	issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits. 
            	You understand that this authorization will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your Microsoft account.

                <strong>Store.</strong> "Store" refers to a Service that allows you to browse, download, purchase, and rate and review applications (the term "application" includes games) and other digital content. These Terms cover use of certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to, the Office Store, Microsoft Store on Xbox and Microsoft Store on Windows). <strong>"Office Store"</strong> means a Store for Office products and apps for Office, Microsoft 365, SharePoint, Exchange, Access and Project (2013 versions or later), or any other experience that is branded Office Store. <strong>"Microsoft Store on Windows"</strong> means a Store, owned and operated by Microsoft or its affiliates, for Windows devices such as phone, PC and tablet, or any other experience that is branded Microsoft Store and accessible on Windows devices such as phone, PC, or tablet. <strong>"Microsoft Store on Xbox"</strong> means a Store owned and operated by Microsoft or its affiliates and made available on Xbox consoles, or any other experience that is branded Microsoft Store and made available on an Xbox console.
                <ul><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">i.
                        <strong>License Terms.</strong> We will identify the publisher of each application available in the relevant Store. Unless different license terms are provided with the application, the Standard Application License Terms (<strong>"SALT"</strong>) at the end of these Terms are an agreement between you and the application publisher setting forth the license terms that apply to an application you download through any Store owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (excluding the Office Store). For clarity, these Terms cover the use of, and services provided by, Microsoft Services. Section 5 of these Terms also applies to any Third-Party Apps and Services acquired through a Store. Applications downloaded through the Office Store are not governed by the SALT and have separate license terms that apply.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">ii.
                        <strong>Updates.</strong> Microsoft will automatically check for and download updates to your applications, even if you’re not signed 
                        into the relevant Store. You can change your Store or system settings if you prefer not to receive automatic updates to Store applications. 
                        However, certain Office Store applications that are entirely or partly hosted online may be updated at any time by the application developer 
                        and may not require your permission to update.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">iii.
                        <strong>Ratings and Reviews.</strong> If you rate or review an application or other Digital Good in the Store, you may receive email 
                        from Microsoft containing content from the publisher of the application or Digital Good. Any such email comes from Microsoft; we do not share your email 
                        address with publishers of applications or other Digital Goods you acquire through the Store.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">iv.
                        <strong>Safety Warning.</strong> To avoid possible injury, discomfort or eye strain, you should take periodic breaks from use of games or 
                        other applications, especially if you feel any pain or fatigue resulting from usage. If you experience discomfort, take a break. 
                        Discomfort might include feelings of nausea, motion sickness, dizziness, disorientation, headache, fatigue, eye strain, or dry eyes. Using 
                        applications can distract you and obstruct your surroundings. Avoid trip hazards, stairs, low ceilings, fragile or valuable items that could 
                        be damaged. A very small percentage of people may experience seizures when exposed to certain visual images like flashing lights or patterns 
                        that may appear in applications. Even people with no history of seizures may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these seizures. 
                        Symptoms may include lightheadedness, altered vision, twitching, jerking or shaking of limbs, disorientation, confusion, loss of consciousness, 
                        or convulsions. Immediately stop using and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms, or consult a doctor before using the 
                        applications if you’ve ever suffered symptoms linked to seizures. Parents should monitor their children’s use of applications for signs of symptoms.</li></ul></li></ul></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span loc="true" class="Description LongDescription"></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span loc="true" class="Header">Microsoft Family Features</span><span loc="true" class="navigationHeader">Microsoft Family Features</span><span loc="false" class="FileName">14c_MicrosoftFamilyFeatures</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span loc="true" class="Description ShortDescription"><ul><li>c.

                        You can enable the Auto Recharge feature when you buy Skype Credit by ticking the appropriate box. If enabled, your Skype Credit 
                        balance will be recharged with the same amount and by your chosen payment method every time your Skype balance goes below the threshold set by Skype from time to time. 
                        If you purchased a subscription with a payment method other than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have enabled Auto-Recharge, 
                        your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to purchase your next recurring subscription. You can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing 
                        and changing your settings in your account portal in Skype.  
                        If your Microsoft Account is closed, for any reason, any unused Skype credit associated with your Microsoft account will be lost and cannot be retrieved. </li><li>xi.

            <strong>Microsoft Rewards.</strong><ul><li>
                i.	Microsoft Rewards (the "<strong>Program</strong>") enables you to earn redeemable points for activities such as qualified searches, acquisitions, and other offers from Microsoft.  Offers may vary by market.  A search is the act of an individual user manually entering text for the good faith purpose of obtaining Bing search results for such user’s own research purposes and does not include any query entered by a bot, macro, or other automated or fraudulent means of any kind ("<strong>Search</strong>").  An acquisition is the process of purchasing goods or downloading and acquiring a license for digital content from Microsoft, whether free or paid ("<strong>Acquisition</strong>").  Rewards points are not offered for every purchase from Microsoft. Microsoft may offer additional opportunities to earn points from time to time, and each points-earning offer will not be available in perpetuity. Your earned points can be redeemed for rewards listed on the redeem page at <a href="https://aka.ms/redeemrewards" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/redeemrewards</a> ("<strong>Rewards</strong>"). For more information see the Rewards section at <a href="https://support.microsoft.com" target="_blank">support.microsoft.com</a> ("<strong>FAQ</strong>").
                <ul><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">1.
                	<em>Program Requirements.</em> You need a valid Microsoft account and your devices must meet 
                	the <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/" target="_blank">minimum system requirements</a> (https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/).  
                	The Program is open to users who reside in the markets listed in the FAQ.  Individuals can have no more than one Program account, 
                	even if an individual has multiple email addresses, and households are limited to six accounts. 
                	The Program is solely for your personal and noncommercial use.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">2.
                	<em>Points.</em> Except for donating your points to a nonprofit organization listed on the redeem page, you cannot transfer points. Points are not your personal property, and you may not obtain any cash or money in exchange for them. Points are awarded to you on a promotional basis.  You cannot purchase points.  Microsoft may limit the quantity of points or Rewards per person, per household, or over a set period (e.g., a day) provided that you are not disadvantaged in breach of good faith. You may redeem no more than 550,000 points per calendar year in the Program. Points earned in the Program are not valid in, and may not be used in combination with, any other program offered by Microsoft or third parties.
                	<strong>Unredeemed points expire if you do not earn or redeem any points for 18 months.</strong></li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">3.
                	<em>Rewards.</em> You may redeem your points or you may contribute points to a listed nonprofit organization by visiting the <a href="https://aka.ms/redeemrewards" target="_blank">redeem page</a> (https://aka.ms/redeemrewards) or by signing up for automatic contributions to non-profit organizations through a giving program. There may be a limited number of a particular Reward available, and those Rewards will be delivered on a first-come, first-served basis. You may be required to provide additional information, like your mailing address and a telephone number (other than a VOIP or toll-free number), and you may also be asked to enter a fraud-prevention code or sign additional legal documents to redeem points for Rewards. Once you order a Reward, you cannot cancel it or return it for a refund of points except in the case of defective products or as required by applicable law. If you order a Reward that is out of stock or unavailable for other reasons, we may substitute a Reward of comparable value or refund your points. Microsoft may update the Rewards offered on the redeem page or discontinue offering specific Rewards. Some Rewards may have age eligibility requirements.  Any such requirements will be included in the relevant offer.  You are responsible for all federal, state, and local taxes and any other costs of accepting and using the Reward.  Rewards will be emailed to the email address associated with your Microsoft account, so keep your email address up to date. Rewards that are undeliverable will not be reissued and are therefore forfeited. Rewards are not for resale. For more information about contributing points automatically to non-profit organizations, see the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/rewards/give-mode-overview" target="_blank">Give with Bing FAQs</a> (https://www.microsoft.com/rewards/give-mode-overview).</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">4.
                	<em>Cancelling Your Participation in the Program.</em> If you no longer wish to participate in the Microsoft Rewards program, follow the instructions on the <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/optout?confirm=false" target="_blank">opt out page</a> (https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/optout?confirm=false). If you opt out, you will immediately lose all of your available points. Your Program account may be cancelled if you do not log in at least once in an 18-month period.  Additionally, Microsoft reserves the right to cancel the Program account of a specific user for tampering with, abusing, or defrauding the Program, or for breach of these terms.  Upon Program cancellation (by you or us) or if the Program is suspended, you will have 90 days to redeem your points; otherwise, those points will be forfeited.  At the point of cancellation, your right to use the Program and accrue future points ends.</li><li>5.
                	<em>Other Conditions.</em> Microsoft reserves the right to disqualify you; disable your access to the Program or your Rewards account; and/or withhold points, Rewards and charitable contributions, if Microsoft believes you are tampering with or abusing any aspect of the Program, ineligible to receive a Reward for legal reasons (such as export laws), or may be engaging in activities that violate these Terms.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span loc="true" class="Description LongDescription"></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span loc="true" class="Header">Azure</span><span loc="true" class="navigationHeader">Azure</span><span loc="false" class="FileName">14m_Azure</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span loc="true" class="Description ShortDescription"><ul><li>m.

                <strong>Disputes Covered—Everything Except IP.</strong> The term "dispute" is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between 
                you and us concerning the Services, the software related to the Services, the Services’ or software’s price, your Microsoft account, advertising, marketing, 
                communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation,

                    rights</strong>.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">b.
                <strong>Send a Notice of Dispute Before Arbitration.</strong> If you have a dispute that our customer service representatives can’t resolve and you wish to pursue arbitration, you must first send an individualized Notice of Dispute to <strong>Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A., or submit the form electronically.</strong> The Notice of Dispute form is available at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499" target="_blank">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499</a>. Complete that form in full, with all the information it requires. We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. This Notice of Dispute is a prerequisite to initiating any arbitration. Any applicable statute of limitations will be tolled from the date of a properly submitted individualized Notice of Dispute through the first date on which an arbitration may properly be filed under this section 15.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">c.
                <strong>Small Claims Court Option.</strong> Instead of sending a Notice of Dispute, either you or we may sue the other party in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action meets the small claims court’s requirements and remains an individual action seeking individualized relief. The small claims court must be in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business).</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">d.
                <strong>Arbitration Procedure.</strong> The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is less than $75,000 whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules).  For more information, see <a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>
                or call 1-800-778-7879. <strong>Section 15 and these Terms govern to the extent they conflict with any applicable AAA rules.</strong> To initiate an arbitration, submit the Demand for Arbitration form available at
                <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497" target="_blank">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497</a> to the AAA and mail a copy to us.  The form must contain information that is specific to you and your claim. In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic or by videoconference unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.  Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business).   The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.
                <strong>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim, but not relief that would affect non-parties.</strong><p>The arbitrator rules on all issues except that a court has exclusive authority: (i) to decide arbitrability, as well as formation, existence, scope, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement; (ii) to decide whether the parties have complied with the pre-arbitration requirements (including the individualized Notice of Dispute and Demand for Arbitration forms); (iii) to enforce the prohibition on class, representative, private attorney-general, or combined actions or proceedings, or public injunctive relief; and (iv) to enjoin an arbitration from proceeding if it does not comply with this section 15.</p><p>If your Notice of Dispute involves claims similar to those of at least 24 other customers, and if you and those other customers are represented by the same lawyers, or by lawyers who are coordinating with each other, you and we agree that these claims will be “Related Cases.” Related Cases may only be filed in batches of up to 50 individual arbitrations at a time, and those individual arbitrations will be resolved in the following manner: (i) for the first batch, each side may select up to 25 of these Related Cases to be filed and resolved in individual arbitrations under this section 15; (ii) none of the other Related Cases may be filed or prosecuted in arbitration until the first batch of up to 50 individual arbitrations is resolved; and (iii) if, after that first batch, the parties are unable to informally resolve the remaining Related Cases, a second batch of Related Cases may be filed, where each side may select up to 25 of the Related Cases to be resolved in individual arbitrations under this section 15. This process of batched individual arbitrations will continue until the parties resolve all Related Cases informally or through individual arbitrations. A court has exclusive authority to enforce this paragraph, including whether it applies to a given set of claims, and to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations that do not comply with this paragraph.</p></li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">e.
                <strong>Arbitration Fees and Payments.</strong><ul><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">i.
                        <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Disputes Involving Less Than $75,000.</strong> We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses if: (i) the dispute involves less than $75,000; and before initiating arbitration (ii) you complied with all pre-arbitration requirements in this section 15, including, if applicable, the Related Cases paragraph. Otherwise, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If, at the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator awards you more than our last written offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, we will: pay you (i) the amount of the award or $1,000 (whichever is more); and; (ii) for any reasonable attorney’s fees you incurred; and any reasonable expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney accrued in connection with your individual  arbitration.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">ii.

If you do, the most recent version of section 15 before the change you rejected will apply.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">g.
                <strong>Severability.</strong> If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court finds any part of this section 15 unenforceable as to any claim or request for a remedy, then the parties agree to arbitrate all claims and remedies subject to arbitration before litigating in court any remaining claims or remedies (such as a request for a public injunction remedy, in which case the arbitrator issues an award on liability and individual relief before a court considers that request). Otherwise, if any other part of section 15 is found to be unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins).</li></ul></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span class="Description LongDescription" loc="true"></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span class="Header" loc="true">Miscellaneous</span><span class="navigationHeader" loc="true">Miscellaneous</span><span class="FileName" loc="false">16_17_18_miscellaneous</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span class="Description ShortDescription" loc="true"><p style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">16. <strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> This section, and sections 1, 9 (for amounts incurred before the end of these Terms), 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18 and those that
