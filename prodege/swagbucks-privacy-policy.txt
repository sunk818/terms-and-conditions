NEW PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy was last updated on: November 1, 2022

Introduction
This "Privacy Policy" is for residents and persons located within the United States and Canada.  For all other visitors, please visit the international version of our Privacy Policy here. We want you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and share your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below). This Privacy Policy outlines the type of information that we collect and receive from and about you via our Services (defined below), and our data practices related thereto, with additional disclosures for California and Nevada residents in the State Privacy Rights section below.  To the extent that there is a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the State Privacy Rights section, the State Privacy Rights section will control as to California and Nevada residents. Please review this Privacy Policy carefully, especially before providing any Personally Identifiable Information through our Services. Our Services are generally operated in and controlled from the United States of America unless otherwise stated.

Our Services may collect and use location-aware and cross-device data for advertising and other purposes.   

IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE US COLLECT, USE, AND SHARE INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY OF THE PRODEGE SITES AND FEATURES OR OUR SERVICES (both as defined below).

Notice of Terms of Use, Including Arbitration: Your use of our Services is subject to our Terms of Use which includes binding individual arbitration of any disputes which may arise in connection with our Services. Please note that your use of our Services constitutes your express agreement to our Terms of Use, including its arbitration provision and class action waiver. Please read the Terms of Use—including the arbitration provisions—carefully, and do not use any of the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services if you do not agree. 

Prodege, LLC and its Affiliates (defined below) (collectively, “Prodege,” “we,” “our” or “us”) own and operate a number of different services, including, without limitation, Swagbucks, MyPoints, InboxDollars, Upromise, CouponCause, Swagbucks Live, Swagit, MyGiftCardsPlus, ySense, Tada, DailyRewards, Pollfish, BitBurst, AdGate Media, Prodege.com, and others that may be added from time to time (collectively, the “Prodege Sites”). This Privacy Policy applies to the Prodege Sites and to all of the features, websites, mobile applications, Internet browser extensions, emails, online services and other functionalities (collectively, the “Features”) available via or related to the Prodege Sites, whether accessed via a computer, mobile device, or other devices you use (each a "Device" and collectively, “Device(s)”), or otherwise (collectively, the “Prodege Sites and Features”), the services available on or through the Prodege Sites and Features, including our emails and other electronic communications (collectively, “our Services”). Unless specifically stated, such as in the State Privacy Rights section, this Privacy Policy only covers information we collect through our Services and does not cover any information we receive or collect offline or collected by any unrelated websites or companies to which we may provide links. By using any of our Services, and/or clicking “Accept” or otherwise acknowledging or consenting to our Terms of Use (“Terms” or “Terms of Use”) and/or this Privacy Policy where that option is made available to you, you accept our practices as outlined in this Privacy Policy, as well as our Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR OUR TERMS OF USE, PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY OF THE PRODEGE SITES AND FEATURES OR OUR SERVICES. Please contact us with any questions regarding this Privacy Policy and our privacy practices. Instructions to contact us can be found in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy (below). 

Information We Collect
When you visit or use any of our Services, you may share and/or we may automatically collect information that identifies you personally. In this Privacy Policy, “Personally Identifiable Information” (or “PII”) refers to any information that can reasonably be used to identify, contact or locate you; provided, however, that the State Privacy Rights section applies a definition of personal information under applicable state law that may be broader than PII. Examples of PII may include, without limitation, your name, your precise location, your credit card number, your email address, your mailing address, and your phone number. We also collect, and may create from PII, information about you that is not PII (“Non-PII”). If we combine PII collected via our Services with other of your PII or with Non-PII, that combined data will be treated as PII subject to this Privacy Policy. 

PII and Non-PII may be collected on, through or in connection with any of our Services.  For example, we may collect PII and/or Non-PII when you create or register for an account with us, fill out surveys, participate in our Card Linked Offer Programs, join a mailing list, upload receipts, correspond with us, enter one of our sweepstakes or contests, choose to submit testimonials, stories, photos or the like, or otherwise volunteer or provide information about yourself.  You may also choose to install and use optional Internet browser extensions, add-ons, or similar plug-in software and technologies (each an "Extension" and collectively “Extensions”) which may collect and use your information in a variety of ways. For example, the Swagbucks Swagbutton, MyPoints Score!, Tada, InboxDollars Billy Button, Upromise Extension, ySense Addon, and similar software or technologies we may offer from time to time are Extensions that allow you to shop directly with our merchant partners and qualify for rewards. The Extensions also provide other features and access to Offers (as defined below), and allow you to monitor your earnings, customize your account information or experience, and other activities. If you install an Extension, we will automatically track certain websites you visit to allow us to provide the aforementioned features and to correlate your browser history, merchant visits, and Prodege Sites and Features engagements to provide better Services and Offers to you. To assist in rewarding you for purchases made through our shopping-rewards features, Tracking Technologies (as defined below) may be placed on your Device when you install and use an Extension or when you click on an affiliate or Ad Network (defined below) link within a shopping-rewards feature. Your browsing activity on our merchant partners’ websites (and other websites you visit) may be tracked by cookies, Extensions, or other Prodege Sites and Features having such tracking capabilities. We may also use GPS or similar geo-location technology to determine the geo-coordinates of where you or your Device are located. In addition, our mobile applications may collect, among other things, certain information automatically, including, but not limited to the type of mobile Device you use, your mobile Device’s unique device identifier (“UDID”), the IP address of your mobile Device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the mobile application. Some or all of this data may be shared with our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services in order to provide you with Offers and for our Data Purposes as further described in the Third Party Services section below. 

We use your PII and other information we collect about you in order to: (i) provide you with our Services; (ii) operate and improve the Prodege Sites and Features; (iii) provide advertising, content, surveys, location-based deals, special offers, promotions and other rewards opportunities (collectively “Offers”); and (iv) for other marketing, administrative, operational, business and commercial purposes subject to applicable law and not inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or other notice by us at collection (collectively, “our Data Purposes”). We may use and disclose Non-PII for any purpose subject to applicable law and not inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or other notice by us at collection. Without limitation, the information, including PII, we collect may be used by itself, aggregated, or combined with unique identifiers (such as Prodege-assigned identifiers, Device IDs, etc.), and shared with (a) our parent companies, subsidiaries, sister companies, trusted agents and affiliated Services that we own and/or operate (“Affiliates”); and (b) our service providers, vendors, advertisers, merchants, survey partners, joint business ventures, and other third parties (collectively, “Trusted Partners”), for purposes related to our business, including, without limitation, advertising, attribution, measurement of campaigns, analytics and research. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no phone number you provide to us or one of our mobile service provider Trusted Partners (currently Airship, Twilio, Telesign, and Button) for purposes of sending you a link for downloading a mobile app, special offer, a security verification, text (SMS) marketing, or otherwise, will be used or shared with any third party to be used for any other purpose, except as may be required by law or legal process or with your consent or at your direction.

If you don’t provide us with or allow us to collect your PII, we generally will be unable to provide you with our Services and you may be unable to use the Prodege Sites and Features.

You may be able to limit data collection by changing the settings on your Device (but key services and features may lose functionality as a result), or as otherwise explained in the sections below.

Information We Receive from Third Parties
We may also receive and supplement the information we directly collect from or about you with information from third parties, such as our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services, and to the extent it is combined with PII collected via our Services it will be governed by this Privacy Policy. If you are on a third party website or service and you opt-in to receive information from us, the third party may forward to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. In addition, we may receive information from our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services to ensure that you properly receive any qualified Offers and/or for our Data Purposes. We may also supplement and combine the PII we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to provide you with Offers and for our Data Purposes, and to the extent it is combined with PII collected via our Services, it will be governed by this Privacy Policy.

Friend Referrals
We may provide you with an opportunity to invite your friends, family, and acquaintances (“Friends”) to use our Services. If you elect to use our referral service for informing a Friend about any of our Services, you may provide us with your Friend’s name and email address. Through our referral service, you may have the ability to direct us to automatically send the Friend one or more emails or other communications, on your behalf, inviting them to visit or register for our Services (which invite may include additional subsequent reminders and communications). You must have your Friend’s consent to provide us with his or her information for this purpose and should not knowingly give us referral information for any person not permitted to use the Prodege Sites and Features, including, without limitation, a child under the age of 13, or a person whose account has previously been suspended or deactivated or a person who resides or is located in a territory where use of the Prodege Sites and Features is not authorized.

Community Features and User Content
The Prodege Sites and Features may provide you the opportunity to participate in, make available, and/or post text (e.g., questions, comments, and suggestions), images, audio, videos, or other content (collectively, “User Content”) publicly through our blogs, chat rooms, forums, interactive features, public-facing member profile, third-party social networking services or other communication functionality (“Community Features”). Please note that certain information, such as your username, Service start date, earning preferences, qualified rewards, profile picture and other profile information we believe will help motivate you and others to participate in our program may be publicly displayed on the Prodege Sites and Features along with User Content. User Content may also contain metadata, which may contain information about or relating to you, that we may also collect, share and use. Anything posted through Community Features is publicly available. This means that others will have access to that User Content and may use it or share it with third parties; this is beyond our control. If you choose to voluntarily disclose PII in the User Content and/or on the Community Features, that information will be considered publicly available information as well. The protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply to publicly available information. In addition, by posting through our Community Features, you are agreeing that we may use your User Content (and excerpts from your User Content) in connection with our Data Purposes.

Third-Party Services
The Prodege Sites and Features contain links to, or otherwise enable the opportunity to interact with (e.g., Facebook button), other websites and other third-party provided services, such as our Trusted Partners, (e.g., when you link to their site to take a survey or transact with them to qualify for rewards) that we do not own, operate nor control (“Third Party Services”). In addition, because aspects of the Prodege Sites and Features include third-party Offers, Third Party Services may collect your information based on your interaction with those Offers, including via Tracking Technologies (defined and discussed below).  In addition, by interacting with Offers via our Services, you authorize and direct us to share your Service-related data, including PII, with the Third Party Service making the Offer.  This helps us and them make and fulfill the Offer, including making it easier for you to sign up for the Offers, facilitating your communications or transactions with them, authenticating and/or validating your identification, crediting you with any qualified rewards, and for our other Data Purposes  These third parties may share information back to us, which we will then use consistent with this Privacy Policy, such as to provide you qualified rewards for engaging in interactions with the third party.  Except for our service providers, the data and other practices of our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage our users to be aware of and to read the privacy statements, terms of service and similar disclosures and conditions of our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services that collect PII or other data before visiting or otherwise interacting with those services.

For more information on Third Party Services, see the following sections of this Privacy Policy:  Advertising Networks and Analytics Companies, Card-Linked Offers Programs and Social Features.  

Advertising Networks, Session Replay and Analytics Companies
Companies that host networks connecting advertisers with delivery platforms for digital advertising (collectively “Ad Networks”), which are Third Party Services, may provide advertising based on your interests, as reflected in your use of our Services, as well as your use of other websites and services. Some of these Ad Networks may place a persistent cookie or other Tracking Technology on your Devices, allowing them to recognize you and/or your Device each time they send you an online advertisement. Ads themselves may also include Tracking Technologies (defined and discussed below). In this way, Ad Networks may compile information about where you see advertisements online and determine which ads you click on, so, for instance, that we and they may provide you with Offers believed to be of most interest to you. We are not the data controller for the cookies or other similar Tracking Technologies that may be placed by these third parties on your Devices, nor do we have responsibility for these third parties’ privacy policies or information collection practices. You may limit or remove such cookies and Tracking Technologies through your Device settings; for more information, visit our Cookies and Tracking Technologies section (below). Likewise, we use certain third-party analytics and/or other technology providers to help us understand how you use our Services, and these companies may set their own cookies and Tracking Technologies on your Devices. For example, we may use third-party services to record and review your interactions with the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services, including mouse movements, clicks, page visits, keystrokes/key touches, and other details, including any PII that you provide.  These "session replay" services help us organize and analyze your interaction data for our Data Purposes, including to improve Prodege Sites and Features and our Services, and to prevent fraud and abuse. We also use Google Analytics to track visitors’ activity on our website. By using any of the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, you expressly consent to the recording and sharing of your data with third-party session replay and related analytics providers. Google Analytics and similar third-party analytics providers may also use web browsing data and other data analysis to improve their own products. For more information on how to limit this activity, including to learn about the opt-out mechanism Google offers, visit our Cookies and Tracking Technologies section (below). These and other Trusted Partners and Third Party Services may collect information about you, including but not limited to your online activities over time and across different websites and services, when you use the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, or other online websites and services. 

Cookies and Tracking Technologies
I.   Use of Tracking Technologies

We set and access, and third parties (including Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services) may set and access, cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, pixels, tags, software development kits (“SDKs”), session replay tools, and other tracking technologies (collectively referred to as “Tracking Technologies”) on your Device(s) in connection with your use of our Services.  Such third parties may collect information across various channels using Tracking Technologies for purposes of delivering more relevant Offers to you. We (as well as our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services) may use a variety of Tracking Technologies in connection with our Data Purposes.  Tracking Technologies may automatically capture PII and certain other information, including, without limitation, your IP Address, UDID, operating system, screen display settings, and browser type, and may detect whether your Device or software has certain capabilities such as a microphone or webcam access. We and our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services generally use Tracking Technologies and the information they generate to support the Prodege Sites and Features and to support our Services, Trusted Partners’ services or Third Party Services including, for instance: (i) by offering you surveys, shopping, and other targeted Offers; (ii) for identity verification; (iii) for analytics; (iv) to ensure compliance with our programs; and (v) to identify and honor your choices (such as opt-outs). Tracking Technologies may also be used as follows: (a) to provide you with convenience when you access the Prodege Sites and Features by remembering that you have visited us before and by remembering your username, password and other user information, and your preferences to help you avoid future re-entry of certain information; (b) to allow us and our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services to understand or predict your interests so we and they can personalize your experience and customize the layout and tailor content shown to you on the Prodege Sites and Features and throughout your online experience with our Services and elsewhere across Devices, web browsers, email, mobile and other applications (in doing so, we and third parties may link the information collected from Tracking Technologies, and from other sources, with other of your PII and other information, and we and they may track your activity (including, without limitation, your web-browsing activity) in order to provide you with Offers and for our Data Purposes); (c) for analytical and statistical purposes, quality control, validation and verification purposes, and to improve the services we, and our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services' offer; and (d) our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services may link the information we share with them (or that they collect) to the cookie(s) stored on your browser or Device, and they may collect information such as your IP address, UDID, browser or operating system type and version, and demographic or inferred-interest information. Our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services may use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms, including but not limited to, computers, mobile devices, and Smart TVs, over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. For example, our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services may deliver an advertisement to you in your web browser based on a purchase you made in a physical retail store, or they may send a personalized marketing email to you based on the fact that you visited a particular website. Our mobile applications may include Tracking Technologies that share your Device’s precise geolocation and other details about your Device (like hardware characteristics, a variety of sensor data, and a list of installed third-party applications) with our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services who may use this information to generate Offers for you, for our Data Purposes, and for advertising, attribution, measurement of campaigns, analytics and research. For example, third-party Tracking Technologies may analyze your mobile application install history to provide you with relevant Offers. See instructions to limit or disable such tracking in this section below; but be aware that limiting such tracking will affect some Device or mobile application functionality and may limit your ability to complete Offers. 

Cookies may include a small data file which are stored on your systems. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For the session cookies, once you close your browser, the cookie terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed or disabled by following your web browser help-file directions.

II.   What Are My Cookie Choices?

You can also exercise control over browser-based cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser, and mobile Devices may offer ad and data limitation choices. Please note that when you use cookie control tools, you will have to change your settings for each browser and Device you use, and your limitation on cookies can limit the functionality of online services you use, including our Services. Use the help function on your browser or click on the applicable links below to learn more:

Google Chrome

Internet Explorer
Edge
Safari
If you block cookies in this manner some of our Features (including the ability to complete Offers or actions and earn rewards), and features on other sites, including those that are essential to basic operations, may not operate as intended. 

One use of cookies is interest-based advertising (“IBA”), which uses your activity information to help provide you with more relevant Offers. To learn more about IBA in general, and exercise certain opt-outs that some Ad Networks  provide, which may include use of geo-location, cross-device data-directed and/or “audience matched advertising” ads, please visit the following ad industry self-regulatory resources: 

Digital Advertising Alliance

Network Advertising Initiative
 (Opt-Outs)

http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp 

We support these self-regulatory programs and expect the Ad Networks we work with to do so as well. If you’d like to opt-out of being tracked by Google Analytics, simply install this add-on to your browser: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

We are not responsible for the completeness, accuracy or effectiveness of any third party cookie choices programs or tools. If you exercise these choice controls they may need to be compiled on each browser and Device you use, and if they use a cookie to signal your opt-out, your choice may no longer be recognizable if you later clear or block cookies. Not accepting cookies (or opting out of cookies), installing ad blocking technologies and/or and disabling analytics providers may make certain features of the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services unavailable to you and may affect our ability to validate whether or not you qualified for a reward by successfully completing an Offer or action.   

Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. At present, we do not believe that there is a consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a user’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

Card-Linked Offers Programs
The Prodege Sites and Features may offer a service enabling you to enroll a qualifying payment card in order to earn rewards or benefits when you make qualifying transactions with participating merchants (“CLO Program”). Your participation in a CLO Program is further governed by our Card Linked Offer Service Terms. If you participate in a CLO Program and provide your payment information for that purpose, we and our Trusted Partners (including, without limitation, Braintree Payments, a division of PayPal, Inc., Visa, Inc., Rewards Network, and Figg, Inc.) will have the right to use and share the transaction information generated in such CLO Program (“CLO Transaction Data”) for the purposes of operating the CLO Program, including, without limitation: (a) to confirm whether you qualify for an Offer; (b) to confirm whether a specific transaction occurred or rewards were earned (for example, the date and amount of your purchase and the last 4 digits of your card number so the merchant can verify your purchase if there is a missing or disputed transaction); (c)  to allow participating merchants and other Trusted Partners to assess the results of their campaign and analyze ways to improve or optimize a CLO Program and its Offers; (d) to create a record of the CLO Transaction Data and thereafter maintain and use such record and CLO Transaction Data in connection with operating the CLO Program; and (e) to provide information in response to a request from a government authority or a payment organization involved in a transaction with you, a merchant, another relevant Trusted Partner, or others. By participating in a CLO Program, you authorize and direct the sharing, exchange, and use of CLO Transaction Data described above and herein by and among us and our Trusted Partners, applicable payment card networks, and participating merchants. Please visit the Card Linked Offer Service Terms to learn more about the data collection, use, and sharing practices related to the CLO Program. If you would like to opt out of card linking and CLO Transaction Data collection in connection with a CLO Program, please visit the card linking section of the applicable Service and remove any payment cards that you no longer wish to be associated with the CLO Program.

Social Features
Certain functionality on our Services may permit interactions that you initiate between our Services and a third-party website or service, such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram and Twitter (“Social Features”), which are Third Party Services. Examples of Social Features include enabling you to “like” or “share” content from our Services with other websites or services; to log-in to our Services using your username and password for a third-party website or service; to transmit content to our Services from your account on a third-party website or service; and to otherwise connect our Services to a third-party website or service. Enabling or interacting with Social Features may also set one or more cookies or other Tracking Technologies on your Device(s). Please refer to the terms of use and privacy policies of such Third Party Services offering such Social Features. If you choose to use Social Features, information you post or provide access to may be shared with the associated Third Party Services or others, and may be publicly displayed on our Services or by the provider of the Social Feature that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party platform that references any of our Services (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with any of our Services in a tweet or status update), your post may be published on the Prodege Sites and Features in accordance with the terms of the third-party website or service and our Terms of Use. Also, both we and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of our Services and the third-party website or service. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a Third Party Service give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections,” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your connections’ web pages, profile pages, groups you or they belong to, or similar pages on a social networking or other third-party website or service. The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected by any Third Party Service via Social Features remains subject to their privacy practices, including whether they continue to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that Third Party Service.

Disclosure of Data
In addition to the types of sharing described throughout this Privacy Policy, we may disclose your PII (and other information related thereto) as described in this section. Residents of California and Nevada should also refer to the section of this Privacy Policy titled “State Privacy Rights” for additional disclosures. To the extent that there is a conflict between this section and the State Privacy Rights section, the State Privacy Rights section will control as to California and Nevada residents. We may disclose your PII and other information when required by law, or where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial or administrative proceeding, a criminal investigation, a court order, or legal process served on us. We may also share your PII and other information at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, or if we in our sole discretion believe there to be a credible situation that requires us to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy for any of the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services. We may also use IP addresses, UDID or other Device, activity or session identifiers to identify users, and we reserve the right (in our sole discretion) to do so in cooperation with our Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services, as well as copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, or law enforcement agencies. These transfers and disclosures may occur without notice to you. We may also share your PII with Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services in connection with their performance of services to, or on behalf of, the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services (and vice versa) and for our Data Purposes. Such services include, for example, customer support, collecting and analyzing information about usage of our Services, delivering (and confirming the successful delivery of) Offers to you via our Services (or elsewhere online), processing payments, operating a CLO Program, analyzing receipt data, verifying activity, and performing our other Data Purposes. In addition, if you use our mobile applications, we may share your current location with our Trusted Partners or other Third Party Services so that we or they may provide you with Offers based on your location, for our Data Purposes, and for advertising, attribution, measurement of campaigns, analytics and research. Please see  Updating Your Information; Choice/Opt-Out section below for information about how you can opt out of such sharing. 

You may share your PII and Non-PII with Trusted Partners and other Third Party Services when you interact with them, such as accepting Offers and taking related actions, and you authorize and direct us to facilitate that sharing when you do so.  For more information of Third Party Services, see the following sections on this Privacy Policy:  Third Party Services, Advertising Networks and Analytics Companies, Card-Linked Offers Programs and Social Features.

We may share or sell aggregate or individualized information about you that may include, without limitation: (1) your PII and related information; (2) your use of the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services; (3) Third Party Services and other websites you visit; and (4) your location and information derived therefrom which we believe reflects your interests. We share this information with Trusted Partners for the purpose of providing you with Offers and for our Data Purposes. For a sample list of Trusted Partners and their respective privacy policies, please visit: https://www.prodege.com/trustedpartners/

Business Transactions
In the event Prodege or any of its Affiliates is involved with a business transition, such as a financing, merger, consolidation, restructuring, acquisition by another company, sale or assignment of rights or assets (or a portion thereof), or other company change, we may transfer users’ information, including PII, and other business data in connection with that business transition (e.g., to a subsequent owner or operator of Prodege or any of our Services, or any affiliates, agents, service providers, or partners of the foregoing), including during the course of any due diligence process.

Updating Your Information, Choice and Opt-Out
You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of any information you submit to us, such as your contact information.

You may opt out of receiving marketing emails by: (i) following the opt-out instructions provided to you in those emails; (ii) visiting your account settings or similar features on the relevant Prodege Sites and Features; or (iii) contacting us as provided in the Contact Us section below.

If you sign up to receive text (SMS) messages from the Prodege Sites and Features, you may unsubscribe from any text SMS messages received by replying “STOP”. If you do not wish to receive advertisements, content, surveys, promotions, Offers, or rewards from us which would be sent to you by virtue of your having installed our Extensions, you should not install or should uninstall such Extensions.

Notification of Changes
We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will provide notice of any material changes by sending you an administrative email and/or posting those changes in places on the Prodege Sites and Features deemed appropriate by us so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances it may be shared with others. Your continued use of any of the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services after delivery of the administrative email to you, or after the changes are posted, constitutes your acceptance of the changes as to any continued use of the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services.

Children's Privacy
The Prodege Sites and Features and our Services are for general audiences and we do not knowingly collect any personal information (as defined by the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)) from children younger than the age of 13. If you are under the age of majority (18 in most states and provinces), you should use the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services only with the permission and guidance of your parent or guardian. If you are under 13, you should not use our Service. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child younger than 13, we will take actions as required by COPPA. If a California resident is known to us to be between 13 and 15 years of age, we will use reasonable efforts to promptly request that such consumer provide their expressed opt-in consent to the sale of their personal information in order to continue to use the Prodege Sites and Features, in accordance with the CCPA and applicable regulations thereunder. California minors have certain rights to remove their own public posts on the Prodege Sites as explained in the California Privacy Rights Section below.

Security
We maintain security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the PII under our control. Please be advised, however, that the Internet and other technologies and communication channels are, by their nature, not entirely secure, and your information may therefore be subject to interception or loss which is beyond our reasonable control. While we strive to protect your PII, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any PII or other information you transmit to us or that we otherwise collect, and any transmission is done at your own risk. Accordingly, as permitted by applicable law, we assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of your PII or other information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other causes beyond our reasonable control.

Location of Processing and Applicable Law
Although we generally maintain our user data in the United States, it is possible that some of the data processing may occur outside of the United States, carried out by companies or individuals under contract with us. While the data protection laws of these countries may vary, we will make every reasonable effort to protect your PII under this Privacy Policy. By using the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services, you consent to this transfer of your PII and non-PII to any server used by Prodege or its Trusted Partners from time to time. If you are not a resident of the United States or Canada, please consult the international version of our Privacy Policy here and be aware that data protection laws in the United States and Canada (as well as the legal procedures for courts, governmental authorities, and parties in civil litigation to obtain access to our user data) may differ substantially from the laws and procedures in your country of residence. If you are located in a country outside the United States and Canada and submit PII to us, you are consenting to the transfer, processing, storage and use of that information in the United States as provided in this Privacy Policy. The interpretation and application of this Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Your use of the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States.

Your State Privacy Rights
I.   California Residents

A.  Your California Privacy Rights Regarding Disclosures for Third Party Marketing (“Shine the Light” Law)

When California residents provide certain personal information to a business, they have the right under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 to request certain disclosures if that business shares that personal information with third parties, and in some cases affiliates, for the third parties’ or affiliates’ direct marketing purposes. Once per calendar year, California residents may request that we provide a list of the companies with which we share their personal information for those third parties’ or affiliates’ direct marketing purposes, and a list of the categories of such personal information that we share. California residents may make such a request, or inquire further about our compliance with this law, by emailing privacyrequest@prodege.com  (or mailing us at the address set forth in the Contact Us section below). Please include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and your California mailing or street address. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by other means nor requests made by non-California residents.   

B.  California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”)

Effective Date: January 1, 2022

As of January 1, 2020, California residents also have the following rights provided to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Civil Code Section 1798.100, et seq. This California Privacy Notice (“Notice”) applies to “Consumers” as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (together with its regulations, the “CCPA”) as a supplement to Prodege’s Privacy Policy and any other privacy policies or notices. In the event of a conflict between any other Prodege policy, statement, or notice and this Notice, this Notice will prevail as to California Consumers and their rights under the CCPA.

Consistent with the CCPA, Section (1) of this Notice covers our collection, use, disclosure, and sale of California Consumers’ “Personal Information” (or “PI”) as defined by the CCPA, except to the extent such PI is exempt from the notice obligations of the CCPA, for the twelve months preceding the Effective Date and will be updated annually. Our current privacy notices at the point of collection, as well as our general privacy policies and other privacy notices may reflect practices that are more current. Section (2) of this Notice explains the rights California Consumers have under the CCPA. 

Consistent with the CCPA, job applicants, current and former employees, and independent contractors (“Personnel”), and subjects of certain business-to-business communications acting solely in their capacity as representatives of another business, are not considered “Consumers” for purposes of this California Privacy Notice or the rights described herein.

As permitted by applicable law, we do not treat deidentified data or aggregate consumer information as PI and we reserve the right to convert, or permit others to convert, your PI into deidentified data or aggregate consumer information, and may elect not to treat publicly available information as PI. We have no obligation to re-identify information or keep it longer than we need it to respond to your requests.   Data exempt from the CCPA is not included in this Notice.

Subject to restrictions and obligations of the CCPA, our vendors may also use your PI for some or all of the above listed business purposes. Our vendors may themselves engage services providers or subcontractors to enable them to perform services for us, which sub-processing is, for purposes of certainty, one of the Other Business Purposes for which we are providing you notice.

We may collect and use your PI for commercial purposes such as for interest based advertising and sharing PI in a manner that is deemed a sale under the CCPA.

We may sell PI (as the term “sell” is defined by the CCPA) for purposes including the following: interest-based advertising and licensing of data. For more information on how to exercise your do-not-sell rights, see the Do Not Sell subsection below.

2.  California Consumer Privacy Rights 

We provide California Consumers the privacy rights described in this section. You have the right to exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA and related regulations. As permitted by the CCPA, any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process (“Verifiable Consumer Request”) as more fully explained in the Right to Know  and Right to Delete sections below. We will not fulfill your Right to Know or Right to Delete request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI. To make a Right to Know or Right to Delete request, follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page here or mail your request to the following address: Prodege, LLC, P.O. Box 70, Manhattan Beach, CA 90267, Attention: Privacy, and respond to any follow up inquiries we make. 

Some PI we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with a particular Consumer for us to be able to verify it pursuant to the CCPA’s verification standards (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). As required by the CCPA, we do not include that PI in response to such requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response. We will use PI provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document our responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.

We will make commercially reasonable efforts: (a) to identify Consumer PI that we collect, process, store, disclose and otherwise use, and (b) to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests. In some cases, particularly with voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest that you receive the most recent version or a summary of your PI and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want the rest or not. We reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive PI yourself. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or overly burdensome. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.

Consistent with the CCPA and our interest in the security of your PI, we will not deliver to you your social security number, driver’s license number or other government-issued id number, financial account number, an account password, security questions or answers, or unique biometric data generated from measurements or technical analysis of human characteristics in response to a CCPA request.

Your California Consumer privacy rights are as follows:

(a)  Right to Know

To make a Right to Know (Categories) or Right to Know (Specific Pieces) request, follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page here or mail your request to the following address: Prodege, LLC, P.O. Box 70, Manhattan Beach, CA 90267; Attention: Privacy, and respond to any follow up inquiries we make. We will respond to your request as outlined in the How to Submit a Request Under the CCPA section below. Please note that PI is retained by us for various time periods, therefore we may not be able to fully respond to what might be relevant going back 12 months prior to the request. 

(i)  Right to Know (Categories)

You have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to the request date:

The categories of PI we have collected about you.
The categories of sources from which we collected your PI.
The business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your PI.
The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your PI.
A list of the categories of PI disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months and, for each, the categories of recipients, or a statement that no disclosure occurred.
A list of the categories of PI sold about you in the prior 12 months and, for each, the categories of recipients, or a statement that no sale occurred.
For categories of information requests, as required by the CCPA, we will apply the verification standards set forth in the How to Submit a Request Under the CCPA  section below.

(ii)  Right to Know (Specific Pieces)

You have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your PI that we have collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and that we are maintaining.

For specific pieces of information requests, as required by the CCPA, we will apply the heightened verification standards set forth in the How to Submit a Request Under the CCPA  section below.

(b)  Right to Delete

Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete your PI that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining. Our retention rights include, without limitation, to complete transactions and services you have requested or that are reasonably anticipated, for security purposes, for legitimate internal business purposes, including maintaining business records, to comply with law, to exercise or defend legal claims, and to cooperate with law enforcement. Note also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not collect directly from you. 

For deletion requests, as required by the CCPA, we will apply the verification standards set forth in the How to Submit a Request Under the CCPA section below

To make a Right to Delete request, follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page here or mail your request to the following address: Prodege, LLC, P.O. Box 70, Manhattan Beach, CA 90267; Attention: Privacy, and respond to any follow up inquiries we make. 

(c)  Do Not Sell

We may “sell” PI as such term is defined under the CCPA, however, we provide California Consumers the opportunity to opt-out of such non-cookie sales (i.e., data licensing) here. You may also mail your request to the following address: Prodege, LLC, P.O. Box 70, Manhattan Beach, CA 90267; Attention: Privacy.

As noted in our Privacy Policy above, there may be cookies and other Tracking Technologies on our Services that provide data treated as PI under the CCPA to other parties who may use it for their own purposes, and who in turn may provide that data to other parties for their own purposes. We do not believe that we sell PI collected by third-parties who operate cookies that collect PI in association with our Services (“Cookie Operators”), which collect PI that falls under the other identifiers (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs) and internet or other electronic activity information categories. However, we will treat PI collected by Cookie Operators, where not limited to acting as our service provider or where the cookie is set in connection with your Offer actions, as a sale and subject to a Do Not Sell opt-out request. For additional information on cookies and alternative choices regarding them, including how to opt-out of certain interest-based advertising, see the Cookies and Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy above. 

If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your PI. We do not knowingly sell the PI of Consumers under 16 unless we receive an opt-in from the Consumer who is at least 13 but under 16, or from the parent or guardian of a Consumer younger than 13. Consumers who opt-in to PI sales may opt out at any time. If you think we may have unknowingly collected PI for sale relating to yourself or of your child under the age of 13, or if you are at least 13 but under 16, exercising the opt-out will stop our selling of the PI.

We may disclose your PI for the following purposes, none of which are a sale: (i) if you intentionally interact with a third party or otherwise authorize or direct us to share PI (such as when you engage with Offers); (ii) to comply with your requests under the CCPA; (iii) disclosures amongst the entities that constitute "Prodege," as defined above, or as part of a merger, stock or or asset sale, or other corporate transaction; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.

(d)  Non-Discrimination 

We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights. However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable PI. In addition, we may offer you financial incentives related to  the collection, sale, retention, disclosure or use of your PI as permitted by the CCPA. By participating in any of our Services you acknowledge that the value of program participation, which may include tangible and intangible benefits, is reasonably related to the data you provide in connection with such programs. If you do not agree, do not participate.  For more information, see our financial incentives statement here. Please note that participating in incentive programs is entirely optional, you will have to affirmatively opt in to each program and you can opt out of each program (i.e., terminate participation and forgo the ongoing incentives) prospectively by following the instructions in the applicable program description and terms. We may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms linked above, so check them regularly.  We may value the personal data collected in connection with our Services by a variety of methods, including program operational costs, benefits value or cost, and/or net revenue generated by licensing program-related data. 

3.  How to Submit a Request Under the CCPA

You have the right to exercise your CCPA rights. You may submit a request to exercise your CCPA rights (1) as an individual; or (2) via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA and related regulations. 

(a)  Methods to Submit a Request

To submit a request to exercise your CCPA rights, or to submit a request as an authorized agent, please follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page here or mail your request to the following address: Prodege, LLC, P.O. Box 70, Manhattan Beach, CA 90267, Attention: Privacy, and respond to any follow up inquiries we make.

(b)  Your Request Must Be a Verifiable Consumer Request

As permitted by the CCPA, any request you submit to us must be a Verifiable Consumer Request. This means that your right to know and deletion requests are subject to an identification and residency verification process. We will not fulfill your Right to Know (Categories), Right to Know (Specific Pieces), or Right to Delete request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected Personal Information. 

You are not required to create a password-protected account with us to make a Verifiable Consumer Request, but you may use your password-protected account to do so. We will use Personal Information provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document our responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose. 

In addition to the above, we verify each request as follows:

Right to Know (Categories): If you do not have a password-protected account, we are required to verify a consumer’s request to know categories of Personal Information to a reasonable degree of certainty.  We have determined that matching at least two data points provided by the consumer with data points maintained by us is a reliable process for verifying such a consumer. 
Right to Know (Specific Pieces): If you do not have a password-protected account, we are required to verify a consumer’s request to know specific pieces of Personal Information to a reasonably high degree of certainty.  We have determined that matching at least three data points provided by the consumer with data points maintained by us is a reliable process for the verifying such a consumer when paired with a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the requestor is the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request. If you fail to provide the required data points or declaration, we will be unable to verify you sufficiently to honor your request, but we will then treat it as a Right to Know (Categories) request. 
Do Not Sell: No additional verification required. 
Right to Delete: If you do not have a password-protected account, we are required to verify a consumer’s request to delete to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by the consumer with data points maintained by us, or to a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by the consumer with data points maintained by us, depending on the sensitivity of the PI and the risk of harm to the consumer posed by unauthorized deletion. 
            (c)  Authorized Agents

Authorized agents may exercise rights on behalf of California Consumers, but we reserve the right to also verify the Consumer’s identity directly as described above. Authorized agents must contact us by submitting a request through our Consumer Rights Request page here and indicating in the open text field that they are submitting the request as an agent. We will require the agent to demonstrate authority to act on behalf of the Consumer by providing, for example, evidence of the agent’s identity, proof of registration with the California Secretary of State (if the agent is a business), and at least one of the following evidencing proof of the agent’s legal authority to act on behalf of the individual Consumer: 

presenting a Power of Attorney granted under the Probate Code that we can reasonably verify; or 
signed permission by the Consumer. 
We may also require the Consumer to verify their own identity directly with us and to directly confirm with us that they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. 

In the absence of any of the general conditions detailed above, we are entitled to reject any request submitted through an agent. In addition, the agent is subject to the verification standards applicable to the type of request(s) made. 

4.  Limitation of Rights

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may collect, use and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law and this may override your CCPA rights. In addition, we need not honor any of your requests to the extent that doing so would infringe upon our or any other person or party’s rights or conflict with applicable law.

C.  California Minors Erasure

Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use our Services, and who posted content or information on our Services, can request removal by contacting us at the mailing address set forth in the Contact Us section below detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you posted it.  We will then make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that we do not control.

II.   Nevada Residents 

Nevada allows customers to “opt-out” of the sale of certain personal information, referred to as “covered information” of Nevada “consumers,” as those terms are defined by Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes. You may contact us as set forth in the  Contact Us section below and provide your name, Nevada resident address, and email address to be verified and exercise your Nevada opt-out rights. If your contact information changes at any point, contact us in the same manner to update your contact information. For more information about our data collection and sharing practices, please review this Privacy Policy. We may share your data as explained in this Privacy Policy for different purposes, such as to make your experience and our Services better, and those activities are separate from any opt-out request.
