newTAB is created by Source Soft Solutions Private Limited. Following are our Terms & Conditions of use that governs newTAB’s relationship with its users & others who interact with newTAB.tech, it’s subdomains (collectively, the “Website”), any information, graphics, videos, text or any other materials uploaded/downloaded/appearing on the website (collectively, the “Content”). These terms & conditions apply to newTAB, and by using the platform in any way, you agree to abide by these Terms in their entirety. For any further clarification, please contact the newTAB Team.

1. Giving Back to Community as “Payback”
newTAB’s mission is to “Giving back to its community” ("Payback" or "Paybacks") from the payments of advertising revenue gained by its users. The following terms govern newTAB's payments to Paybacks:

Any "Raised", "Given", and "Earned" dollar amounts are our team's good-faith projections of how much advertising revenue users have earned based on their usage of the newTAB platform. Please note that in the case that newTAB does not receive payment from its partners for any reason, including but not limited to advertisement click-fraud, newTAB is not responsible for making any payments to Paybacks and reserves the right to modify the displayed dollar amounts accordingly.

newTAB's payments to Paybacks are made within 120 days of the end of every fiscal quarter. Any displayed dollar amount "Raised", "Given", or "Earned" simply indicates that newTAB has designated funds for payment to a particular Payback, and in no way reflects when the Payback actually receives these funds.

All dollar amounts listed on the Website represent United States Dollars.

Although newTAB makes payments of user-generated funds to the Paybacks users designate, all user-generated funds are considered the wholly-owned revenue of newTAB and all payments to Paybacks are considered payments directly from newTAB to the designated Paybacks. Users have no legal claim to redeem these funds from newTAB, nor any legal claim to exert control over these funds in any way. Users must be aware that they may not legally attempt to deduct from their taxes any amounts "raised" on newTAB and that to do so may be illegal in the user's tax jurisdiction.

2. Payments to Charity
newTAB also generates Donations from the advertising revenue for nonprofit charity organizations that users care about. T&C described for “Payback” applies on an “as is” basis to the Donations for nonprofit charity organizations.

3. Selection and Continuance of Paybacks
Paybacks that operate on the Website are selected based on whether they:

● are geographically broad in scope (for example, national or international in scope)

● are 501(c)(3) organizations maintain accessible and transparent financial statements

newTAB reserves all rights to choose the Paybacks that are to operate on the Website.

newTAB reserves the right to remove a Payback from its website or discontinue all payments to a Payback at any time and without reason. In such a case, newTAB will evenly distribute that Payback's unpaid earnings to all other Paybacks on the website.

If at any time the administration of a Payback for which newTAB raises revenue requests that newTAB remove the Payback from the Website or discontinue all payments to said Payback, newTAB will comply within fourteen (14) days from the date of receiving a written request from a verifiable member of the Payback's administration. In such a case, newTAB will evenly distribute that Payback's unpaid earnings to all other Paybacks on the website.

By listing a Payback on its website or raising revenue for a Payback, newTAB does not necessarily imply any formal relationship with that Payback. newTAB is not operated by any members of administration from the Paybacks listed on the Website.
