2. WHAT MAKES CHUMBA CASINO CLASSIFY A CUSTOMER AS HIGH RISK?
Chumba Casino continually screens accepted customer’s information, purchases, redemptions, game
activity and behaviours for relevant financial crime risk indicators. Depending on the specific facts and
context, customers will be classified as having a low, medium or high risk level. Chumba Casino will
classify a customer as high risk where they present or are likely to present money laundering, funding of
terrorism or other financial crime risk which has financial or reputational consequences to Chumba
Casino.
While Chumba Casino seeks to investigate any financial crime risk alerts within a reasonable timeframe,
compliance with applicable laws may result in delays while additional due diligence is conducted and
relevant information obtained.
3. WHAT KIND OF EXTRA INFORMATION WILL CHUMBA CASINO REQUEST?
If Chumba Casino classifies you as high risk or determines that extra information is required, you may
be asked to provide information on, or evidence of, your:
• income-generating activities
• estimated net worth or sources of wealth
• anticipated pattern and level of Gold Coin purchases
• sources of funds used on a particular Gold Coin purchase transaction or series of Gold Coin purchase
transactions
• identity attributes in question including name, date of birth and address.
If you fail or refuse to submit, within the timeframe communicated by Chumba Casino, the required
information, Chumba Casino reserves the right to terminate the business relationship with you and close
your account.
4. WHY DOES CHUMBA CASINO DO THIS?
Chumba Casino is required to maintain an anti-financial crime compliance programme which includes

whom it assesses as having an acceptable level of risk. This requirement is set by:
• the laws applicable to Chumba Casino
• its third party service providers
