Updates to Chumba Casino Terms
T&Cs Version: 7.0
Sweeps Rules Version: 8.0
Date of Update: 15 December 2023
We’ve updated our T&Cs and Sweeps Rules (together, the “Terms”).
A short summary of the material changes is set out below:
• Clause 8.4(b) of the T&Cs and clause 6.8 of the Sweeps Rules allow us to limit Prize
redemptions as necessary to satisfy our regulatory obligations or the requirements of our
partners and suppliers. Note that this change does not prevent players from redeeming the
full value of any Prizes won in accordance with the Terms, but instead may limit the amount
that a player can redeem over a certain period.
• Clause 15 of the T&Cs clarifies that the Platform or any feature of it may not be available in
all territories and jurisdictions.
The updates to the Terms include other changes so you should read them in full here: T&Cs and
Sweeps Rules.
