The Sweeps Coins will be added to the Participant's Customer Account. NOTE: A Participant must ensure that their handwriting is legible. If the Participant's handwriting is not legible, the entry will be void and the Sweeps Coins will not be credited to the Participant's Customer Account. The legibility of a Participant's handwriting will be determined by Sponsor/Promoter in its sole discretion. THE REQUEST MUST ONLY BE MADE BY THE PARTICIPANT AND MUST BE POSTED FROM THE SAME STATE OR PROVINCE AS THE PARTICIPANT'S VERIFIED RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. Requests made by any other individual or any entity (including but not limited to commercial sweepstakes subscription notification and/or entering services) or posted from a State or Province different to the Participant's verified residential address will be declared invalid and Sweeps Coins will not be credited to the Participant's Customer Account. Tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Sweepstakes, including but not limited to the use of any device to automate the Sweeps Coins request/entry process or to unfairly assist the Participant with meeting the handwriting requirement, is prohibited and any requests/entries deemed by Sponsor/Promoter, in its sole discretion, to have been submitted in this manner will be void. In the event a dispute regarding the identity of the individual who actually submitted a request or whether a request satisfies the requirements set out above cannot be resolved to Sponsor/Promoter's satisfaction, the affected request/entry will be deemed ineligible.
A Postal Request Code is a unique combination of 12 digits that Participants can obtain by following the steps outlined in clause 3.5 of these Sweeps Rules. A Postal Request Code is unique and can only be used once.The purpose of a Postal Request Code is to assist with the efficient and effective processing of a Participant's Request Card. A POSTAL REQUEST CODE CAN ONLY BE USED BY THE PARTICIPANT WHOSE CUSTOMER ACCOUNT WAS USED TO GENERATE THAT POSTAL REQUEST CODE.Any Participant suspected by Sponsor/Promoter to have directly or indirectly provided a Postal Request Code to another person may, in the sole discretion of Sponsor/Promoter, be disqualified and lose their eligibility to Participate in the Sweepstakes.
A Postal Request Code can be obtained by following each of these steps:
sign into your Customer Account;
click on the “Postal Request Code” link in the Lobby;
click on the “Postal Request Codes” button and follow the prompts.
The Postal Request Code is then displayed for a period of time to enable a Participant to record it on their Request Card.
The amount of Sweeps Coins a Participant has will be displayed in their Customer Account on the website. The amount of Sweeps Coins to be allocated to Participants can be changed at any time by the Sponsor/Promoter in its sole discretion.
Sponsor/Promoter is not responsible for lost, late, incomplete, invalid, unintelligible or misdirected Sweeps Coins requests or allocations.
In the event of a dispute as to any registration of a Customer Account, the authorized account holder of the email address used to register the Customer Account will be deemed to be the Participant. The “authorized account holder” is the natural person assigned the email address by an internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address.
Use of any automated or other system(s) to Participate, to acquire Sweeps Coins or play the games is prohibited and will result in disqualification and loss of eligibility to Participate in the games.
Sweeps Coins are only valid for sixty (60) days from the date a Participant last logged on to their Customer Account and will then automatically expire.
Sweeps Coins may also be forfeited if a Participant's Customer Account is closed for any reason, or at the Sponsor/Promoter's discretion.
USING SWEEPS COINS TO PLAY GAMES
Participants with Sweeps Coins can use those Sweeps Coins to play games within Chumba Casino for a chance to win additional Sweeps Coins. Sweeps Coins won through game play can be redeemed for real prizes.
Within Chumba Casino there are different games. The amount of Sweeps Coins required to play each game will be detailed next to the game. A Participant may be able to increase the amount of Sweeps Coins they play the game with so they can increase their potential winning eligibility.
Only games played with Sweeps Coins provide the opportunity to redeem winnings for real prizes. The prize that can be won while playing a game will be shown in Chumba Casino by clicking the “Win Table” or “Pay Table” button, denominated as “Sweeps Coins”.
Each Sweeps Coin that has been won through game play (rather than collected using one of the methods described in clause 3 of these Sweeps Rules) can be redeemed for a prize with value being equivalent to US$1.
Sponsor's/Promoter's decisions as to the administration and operation of the Sweepstakes, the game and the amount of winnings are final and binding.
Unless Sponsor/Promoter requires otherwise, any Sweeps Coins allocated to a Participant are required to be played once before they are eligible to be redeemed for prizes. Sponsor/Promoter may, in its sole discretion, require that any Sweeps Coins allocated to a Participant must be played a greater number of times (not exceeding 20) in any combination of Sweeps Coins games before they are eligible to be redeemed for prizes.
Sponsor/Promoter reserves the right to change the prize win rates and odds of any of the Sweepstakes at any time. A Participant can see the actual and any amended details by clicking on the “Win Table” or “Pay Table” button. It is a Participant's responsibility to check the prize win rate on each occasion before they participate.
VERIFICATION AND CONFIRMATION OF POTENTIAL WINNERS
POTENTIAL SWEEPSTAKES WINNERS ARE SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY SPONSOR/PROMOTER (IN ANY MANNER IT MAY CHOOSE) AND THE DECISIONS OF SPONSOR/PROMOTER ARE FINAL AND BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE SWEEPSTAKES. A PARTICIPANT IS NOT A WINNER OF ANY PRIZE, EVEN IF THE ONLINE SCREEN INDICATES THEY ARE, UNLESS AND UNTIL THE PARTICIPANT'S ELIGIBILITY AND THE POTENTIAL WINNING PLAY HAS BEEN VERIFIED AND THE PARTICIPANT HAS FULLY COMPLIED WITH THESE SWEEPS RULES AND BEEN NOTIFIED THAT VERIFICATION IS COMPLETE. SPONSOR/PROMOTER WILL NOT ACCEPT SCREEN SHOTS OR OTHER PURPORTED EVIDENCE OF WINNING IN LIEU OF ITS VALIDATION PROCESS.
Potential prize winners must comply with these Sweeps Rules and winning is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements.
A potential prize winner may be required to sign and return to Sponsor/Promoter, an affidavit/declaration of eligibility, and liability/publicity release (except where prohibited) in order to claim his/her prize (if applicable). In addition, in the case of a Canadian eligible winner, he/she will be required to correctly answer a mathematical skill-testing question without mechanical or other aid to be administered at a pre-arranged mutually convenient time.
If a potential winner cannot be contacted, fails to properly execute and return the affidavit/declaration of eligibility and liability/publicity release within the required time period (if applicable), fails to comply with these Sweeps Rules (including, but not limited to, the requirement to correctly answer the mathematical skill-testing question if a resident of Canada), or if the prize or prize notification is returned as undeliverable, that potential winner forfeits the prize.
In the event that a potential winner of a Sweepstakes prize is disqualified for any reason, Sponsor/Promoter may, in its sole discretion, reseed the prize back into the Sweepstakes.
PRIZES
A Participant's Sweeps Coins balance is shown in the Participant's Customer Account.
Where a Participant has chosen to redeem prizes for cash, the cash payment will be paid in USD to the financial account or online wallet from which you purchased Gold Coins, or if this is not technically possible, then to an alternative bank account you nominate. Sponsor/Promoter reserves the right to require the use of the same payment method for redemption of prizes as was used to purchase Gold Coins, or a specific payment method at Sponsor/Promoter’s discretion.
Where a Participant has chosen to redeem prizes for gift cards, the gift cards will be allocated to the email address that the Participant has registered against their Customer Account.
Sponsor/Promoter will only process a prize redemption if the redeemed value of the prize is US$100 or more (i.e. a minimum of 100 eligible Sweeps Coins). Consequently, a Participant's Customer Account must have a balance of at least 100 Sweeps Coins before requesting a prize redemption.
TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A SWEEPS COINS PRIZE OR A SWEEPS COINS PRIZE REDEMPTION:
A PARTICIPANT MUST BE AN ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANT; AND
THE PARTICIPANT'S DETAILS MUST MATCH THOSE OF THE PARTICIPANT'S ACCOUNT.
In New York and Florida, the maximum redemption value of a Sweeps Coins prize won on any one spin or play, via a Participant's participation in the Sweepstakes is US$5,000. Any prize valued in excess of US$5,000 will be reduced to a maximum value of US$5000.
Sponsor/Promoter reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to limit a Participant's redemption of Sweeps Coins to US$10,000 per day. No more than the stated number of prizes will be awarded.
Sponsor/Promoter is not responsible for any taxes or fees associated with a prize redemption. Participants are responsible for all applicable taxes and fees associated with prize receipt and/or redemption.
Sponsor/Promoter is not responsible for any foreign exchange transaction fees, charges or related costs that may be incurred as a result of, or in relation to, a prize redemption, including but not limited to any losses or additional costs arising from foreign exchange fluctuations.
Sweeps Coins are not transferable and no substitution will be made except as provided herein at the Sponsor's/Promoter's sole discretion. Sponsor/Promoter reserves the right to substitute the listed prize of equal or greater value for any reason owing to circumstances outside Sponsor's/Promoter's reasonable control.
