If you reside in or access the Games at any time while located in the United States, this clause 24(Dispute Resolution and Agreement to Arbitrate on an Individual Basis) shall be construed under and be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding any other choice of law set out in these Terms of Service.  By agreeing to these Terms of Service, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you and VGW Group agree that any and all past, present and future disputes, claims or causes of action between you and VGW Group arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, the Platform and Games, the formation of these Terms of Service or any other dispute between you and VGW Group or any of VGW Group's licensors, distributors, suppliers or agents, and whether arising prior to or after your agreement to this clause 24, (collectively, "Dispute(s)") will be governed by the procedure outlined below.  You and VGW Group further agree that any arbitration pursuant to this clause 24shall not proceed as a class, group or representative action.24.1.Informal Dispute Resolution.VGW Group wants to address your concerns without the need for a 
formal legal dispute.  Before filing a claim against VGW Group, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contactingsupport@luckylandslots.com.  Similarly, if you have provided an email address to us as part of your Customer Account registration, VGW Group agrees to do the same.  If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days after the email noting the Dispute is sent, you or VGW Group may initiatean arbitration proceeding as described below.24.2.We Both Agree To Arbitrate.By agreeing to these Termsof Service, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you and VGW Group each and both agree to resolve any Disputes –including any Dispute concerning the enforceability, validity, scope or severability of this agreement to arbitrate –through final and bindingarbitration as discussed herein.24.3.Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate.You may decline this agreement to arbitrate by contactingarbitrationoptout@luckylandslots.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms of Service and stating that you (include your first and last name, email address and postal address) decline this arbitration agreement.

Those rules are available atwww.jamsadr.com.  Arbitration will proceed on an individual basis and will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules; provided that the parties shall be presented with a list of five potential arbitrators and shall rank those potential arbitrators inorder of preference.  JAMS shall select the arbitrator with the highest combined preference (e.g., if both parties select a potential arbitrator as their top preference, that arbitrator will be selected).  You and VGW Group further agree that, unless and only to the extent prohibited under JAMS Rules, the arbitration will be held in New York, New York, or, at either your or our election, will be conducted telephonically or via other remote electronic means.  The JAMS Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.  The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any remedies, including injunctive relief, that would be available to you in an individual lawsuit and that are not waivable under applicable law.  24.5.Proceedings Requiring Three Arbitrators.  Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in clause 24.4, if a party either seeks a monetary award in excess of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) or seeks an equitable form of relief that would significantly impact other VGW Group users, in each case as reasonably determined by either party, the parties agree that such arbitration will proceed on an individual basis but will be handled by a panel of three (3) arbitrators and take place pursuant to the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Comprehensive Rules”).  Each party shall select one neutral arbitrator, with the third neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Rules.  That third arbitrator shall serve as chair of the arbitral panel and must be a retired judge with experience arbitrating or mediating disputes.  In the event of disagreement as to whether the threshold for a three-arbitrator panel has been met, the sole arbitrator appointed in accordance with this clause 24.5shall make that determination.  If the arbitrator determines a three-person panel is appropriate, the arbitrator may –if selected by either party or through the JAMS selection process –participate in the arbitral panel.  You and VGW Group agree that any award issued by a three-arbitrator panel may be appealed in accordance with the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedures at either party’s election.24.6.Batch Arbitration.To increase efficiency of resolution, in the event 25 or more similar arbitration demands against VGW Group, presented by or with the assistance of the same law firm or organizationor group of law firms or organizations working in coordination, are submitted to JAMS in accordance with the rules described above within a 30-day period, JAMS shall consolidate those arbitrations as contemplated in the JAMS Rules by (a) grouping the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 25 demands per batch (plus, to the extent there are fewer than 25 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining demands); and (b) providing for resolution of each batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and one 
arbitrator assigned per batch.  For avoidance of doubt, consolidation does not require that all arbitrations in a single batch be decided the same, nor does it impair your right to present any evidence or argument that you think particular to your case, solong as consistent with JAMS Rules.  You agree to cooperate in good faith with VGW Group and JAMS to implement such a batch approach to resolution and fees.24.7.Class Action and Collective Arbitration Waiver.TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER YOU NOR VGW GROUP SHALL BE ENTITLED: TO CONSOLIDATE, JOIN OR COORDINATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES; TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY GROUP, CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR MASS ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION; TO ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING AS A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER OF A CLASS; TO ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY; OR OTHERWISE TO SEEK TO RECOVER LOSSES OR DAMAGES (WHETHER FOR YOURSELF OR OTHERS) INCURRED BY A THIRD PARTY.
